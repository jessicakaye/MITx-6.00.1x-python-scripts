# PROBLEM 2
#
# Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
# 
# Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' occurs in s. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print
#

numBobs = 0
for x in range(len(s)):
    if s[x:x+3] == 'bob':
        numBobs+=1
print("Number of times bob occurs is:" + str(numBobs))
